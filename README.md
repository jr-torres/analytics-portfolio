I'm JR, a Statistics graduate with advanced expertise in statistical analysis and methodological design. I specialize in deriving rigorous, actionable insights from complex datasets using techniques such as ANOVA (including mixed and repeated measures), regression modeling, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), meta-analysis, and multivariate analysis including Cluster Analysis, Factor Analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

My experience spans survey methodologies, experimental design, simulation-based validation, and statistical consulting—enabling precise and methodologically sound analysis across diverse research domains. I drive impactful outcomes by selecting and applying the most appropriate statistical techniques aligned with research objectives, ensuring data integrity through meticulous cleaning and preprocessing, and delivering compelling visualizations and summaries for both technical and non-technical audiences. I leverage Excel for quick but effective data cleaning, R and Python to execute statistical workflows, utilize Power BI for dynamic data visualization, and craft clear, concise reports to communicate findings with clarity and purpose.

Currently, I serve as an HR Analyst specializing in workforce analytics, and I previously worked in marketing analytics with a focus on econometrics—experiences that refined my ability to translate statistical theory into practical, data-driven decisions and strategic research support.
